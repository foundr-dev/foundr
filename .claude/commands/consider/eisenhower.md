# /consider:eisenhower

Eisenhower Matrix - sort by urgent vs important to prioritise.

## Usage

```
/consider:eisenhower
```

## The Principle

Two dimensions: Urgent (time-sensitive) and Important (high impact).
This reveals what to do, delegate, schedule, or eliminate.

## The Matrix

```
                    URGENT          NOT URGENT
              ┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
   IMPORTANT  │   Q1: DO NOW   │  Q2: SCHEDULE   │
              │   Crises       │  Planning       │
              │   Deadlines    │  Development    │
              │   Emergencies  │  Prevention     │
              ├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
NOT IMPORTANT │  Q3: DELEGATE  │  Q4: ELIMINATE  │
              │   Interrupts   │  Time wasters   │
              │   Some meetings│  Busywork       │
              │   Some emails  │  Procrastination│
              └─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

## Questions to Ask

For each task:
- [ ] Is this time-sensitive? (Urgent)
- [ ] Does this have high impact? (Important)
- [ ] What happens if I don't do this?
- [ ] What's the best use of my time right now?

## Actions by Quadrant

| Quadrant | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Q1 | Do immediately |
| Q2 | Schedule specific time |
| Q3 | Delegate or batch |
| Q4 | Eliminate or ignore |

## Common Mistake

Living in Q1 (always urgent) while neglecting Q2 (important but not urgent).
Q2 is where growth and prevention happen.
