# /consider:opportunity-cost

Evaluate true cost - what are you giving up by choosing this?

## Usage

```
/consider:opportunity-cost
```

## The Principle

The cost of something isn't just its price - it's everything you give up by choosing it.

Every decision closes other doors. What doors are you closing?

## Questions to Ask

- [ ] What else could we do with this time?
- [ ] What are we NOT building by building this?
- [ ] What's the best alternative use of these resources?
- [ ] What would we do if we couldn't do this?

## Framework

```
True Cost = Direct Cost + Opportunity Cost

Opportunity Cost = Value of Best Alternative Not Chosen
```

## Examples

### Building Feature A vs Feature B
- Direct cost: Development time for A
- Opportunity cost: Not having Feature B (and its benefits)

### Writing Tests vs Shipping
- Direct cost: Time writing tests
- Opportunity cost: Delayed feedback from users

### Refactoring vs New Feature
- Direct cost: Time refactoring
- Opportunity cost: New feature not shipped

## Common Mistakes

- Ignoring opportunity cost entirely
- Only considering monetary costs
- Not evaluating alternatives
- Sunk cost fallacy (past costs are irrelevant)

## Decision Making

When choosing between options:
1. List all viable alternatives
2. Estimate value of each
3. Choose the highest value option
4. Accept that you're giving up the second-best
