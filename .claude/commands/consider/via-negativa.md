# /consider:via-negativa

Via Negativa - improve by removing, not adding (less is more).

## Usage

```
/consider:via-negativa
```

## The Principle

Often the best improvement is subtraction, not addition.
Remove the bad before adding the good.

"Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

## Questions to Ask

- [ ] What can we remove?
- [ ] What's not being used?
- [ ] What adds complexity without value?
- [ ] What would happen if we deleted this?
- [ ] What's the cost of keeping this?

## Application

- Eliminate edge case handling nobody needs

### Process
- Remove unnecessary meetings
- Eliminate approval bottlenecks
- Cut redundant documentation

### Architecture

- Simplify data flow

## Benefits of Removal

- Less code to maintain
- Fewer bugs to create
- Simpler mental model
- Faster builds
- Easier onboarding

## Resistance to Removal

Watch for:
- "Someone might need this"
- "It took a lot of work to build"
- "Just in case"
