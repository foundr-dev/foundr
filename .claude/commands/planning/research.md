# /planning:research

Research a problem systematically before planning or implementation.

## Usage

```
/planning:research <topic or problem>
/planning:research why authentication fails on token refresh
/planning:research how caching works in this codebase
```

## Behavior

1. **Define Research Question**
   - Clarify what we're trying to understand
   - Identify scope and boundaries

2. **Explore Codebase**
   - Search for relevant code
   - Read related files
   - Trace execution paths

3. **Form Hypotheses**
   - Based on evidence found
   - Test each hypothesis

4. **Document Findings**
   - What was discovered
   - Confidence levels
   - Supporting evidence

5. **Recommendations**
   - What to do next
   - Planning or implementation suggestions

## Output

Research findings with:
- Clear answer to the research question
- Evidence and references
- Confidence level (high/medium/low)
- Recommended next steps

## When to Use

- Before implementing unfamiliar functionality
- When debugging complex issues
- When planning significant changes
- When understanding existing patterns
